# Lending Club Case Study and Default Analysis
> A case study on how real business problems are solved using EDA. Here, apart from applying the techniques in EDA, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## General Information

### Intro -

This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. you

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.


### Project Background -

Loan Lending Domain which may choose to  utilize this  knowledge for its  portfolio and risk  assessment of  new loan  applicants


### Business Problem Being Solved Here -

Identification of  Loan Applicant  traits that tend to be risky applicants as they are more likely  ‘defaulters’


### Dataset being used here -

The dataset used here contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

## Conclusions
- Loans  that have higher interest rate have more defaulters. Check the background of applicant  thoroughly if interest rate is high.

- Extra interest rates or risk assessments must be done for the applicants  belonging to CA state, as tendency to default is  high.

- When the purpose is debt consolidation then the lender must check the applicant thoroughly as it has high tendency to  default (risky applicant).
